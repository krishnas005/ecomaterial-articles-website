        Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is a lightweight and high-strength composite material extensively utilized in aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment industries. Known for its exceptional tensile strength of 1500 MPa and density of 1600 kg/m³, CFRP offers superior performance in applications requiring strength-to-weight optimization. Its outstanding fatigue resistance (90), impact resistance (80), and crashworthiness (85) make it a reliable choice for structural components like aircraft fuselages, car body panels, and sports gear.

        CFRP exhibits excellent thermal stability, with a thermal conductivity of 8 W/mK and a thermal expansion coefficient of 1.5 µm/m°C, ensuring minimal deformation under temperature changes. It boasts high corrosion resistance (90) and chemical stability (90), making it durable in harsh environments. The material's recyclability score is 75, with a sustainability rating of 7 and a carbon footprint value of 40, reflecting its moderate eco-friendliness. Additionally, its hardness is rated at 200 HV, and its Young's modulus is 240 GPa, contributing to its stiffness and structural integrity.

        Other key attributes of CFRP include scratch resistance (80), UV resistance (85), and fire resistance (80), ensuring longevity and resilience. Its abrasion resistance (85), puncture resistance (75), and resistance to deformation (90) enhance its reliability under physical stresses. Though its machinability (50) and formability (40) are relatively low, its joining capability (70) allows efficient integration into assemblies. With a surface finish rating of 85 and noise reduction capability of 60, it ensures aesthetic and functional performance. CFRP's cost per unit is 150, reflecting its premium nature, and it is often sustainably sourced, with a sourcing score of 70.
