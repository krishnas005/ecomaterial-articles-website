        Advanced High-Strength Steel (AHSS) is a highly versatile material extensively used in industries such as automotive, construction, and aerospace for its exceptional mechanical and environmental properties. Its remarkable combination of strength, durability, and sustainability makes it ideal for manufacturing critical components like chassis, body structures, roofs, seatbelts, front grills, pillars, sidebars, and shields. AHSS provides outstanding tensile strength of 1200 MPa, ensuring robust performance under extreme conditions. It also exhibits excellent crashworthiness (90), energy absorption (85), and fatigue resistance (80), which are crucial for safety and longevity. Its recyclability score of 95 and sustainability rating of 8 highlight its eco-friendliness, complemented by a carbon footprint value of 70.

        The material demonstrates good impact resistance (85), corrosion resistance (65), and chemical stability (85), making it reliable in harsh environments. Its thermal conductivity is 50 W/mK, with a thermal expansion coefficient of 12 µm/m°C and heat resistance of 80, ensuring stability under temperature variations. AHSS is lightweight with a density of 7800 kg/m³ and a weight score of 70, contributing to fuel efficiency in automotive applications. Other key attributes include high ductility (15), hardness (250 HV), and Young's modulus of 210 GPa, which provide a balance between flexibility and rigidity.

        Additionally, AHSS features surface finish (70), formability (60), machinability (70), and excellent joining capability (90), enabling versatile fabrication methods. Its oxidation resistance (60), UV resistance (80), and scratch resistance (70) ensure longevity and maintain aesthetic appeal. With fire resistance (85) and abrasion resistance (75), it performs well in high-risk applications. The material also offers moderate properties in noise reduction capability (65), thermal insulation (60), and comfort (50). Though less breathable (40), its puncture resistance (70) and resistance to deformation (85) reinforce its reliability. Lastly, AHSS's cost-effectiveness is evident with a cost per unit of 50, alongside sustainable sourcing practices rated at 80.
